# Mushrooming

Game completely written in JS to learn OOP in practice

Configuration:

-   webpack + babel

## To do:

-   optimize images and gifs
-   separate class (example: in my opinion Pawn.js class should be saved in at least two similar classes in individual folder)
-   create package based on this project for board game (+create redable api)
